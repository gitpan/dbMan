This software provides some functionality in database managing
(SQL console).

Depends on installation of Term::Size, Text::FormatTable, Locale::gettext,
Data::ShowTable, Data::Dumper, DBI and some DBD driver.

This version is one of try of remake dbMan. Full functioned version
of last generation are 0.1.1 and you can download it from 
http://dbman.linux.cz/

From 0.19 I try merging old stable branch and new remake.
Due to bugs in core DBIx::dbMan in 0.20 and sooner you can't use
candidate-select algorithm. You must upgrade to 0.21 or later 
(recommended to 0.23 and later).

From 0.32 Tk version change state to "obsolete" and new project of
gtkdbman was started by Ondra Kudlik <kudlik@pef.mendelu.cz>. dbMan
core project includes most of gtkdbman core patches inside.
