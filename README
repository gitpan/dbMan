If you plan to use this program you must respect LICENSE file.

This software provides some functionality in database managing
(SQL console).

Depends on installation of Term::Size, Text::FormatTable, Locale::gettext,
Data::ShowTable, Data::Dumper, DBI and some DBD driver.

Can use also optional Term::Screen and Term::ReadLine modules.

This version is one of try of remake dbMan (last generation ended at 0.1.1).

From 0.19 I try merging old stable branch and new remake.
Due to bugs in core DBIx::dbMan in 0.20 and sooner you can't use
candidate-select algorithm. You must upgrade to 0.21 or later 
(recommended to 0.23 and later).

	perl Makefile.PL
