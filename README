If you plan to use this program you must respect LICENSE file.

This software provides some functionality in database managing
(SQL console).

Depends on installation of Term::Size, Locale::gettext,
Text::FormatTable, Data::ShowTable, DBI and some DBD driver.

This version is one of try of remake dbMan. Full functioned version
of last generation are 0.1.1 and you can download it from 
http://dbman.linux.cz/

From 0.19 I try merging old stable branch and new remake.
Due to bugs in core DBIx::dbMan in 0.20 and sooner you can't use
candidate-select algorithm. You must upgrade to 0.21 or later 
(recommended to 0.23 and later).
