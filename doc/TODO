High priority

	longsql in history as one line
	multiline sql commands (\e editing)
	\copy, \cut commands
	warning from extensions
	NULL print as NULL not empty strings - probable bug in extension ?
	one line changing output formats (e.g. plain or records - for Alesh)
	execute command (transform to form: begin blabla; end;)
